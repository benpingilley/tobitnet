# Penalized gTobit Regression

The `gtobitnet` package provides methods for fitting penalized gTobit models: 

- `gtobitnet` fits the gTobit model with a weighted elastic net penalty using generalized coordinate descent
- `gtobitscad` fits the gTobit model with a SCAD penalty using a local linear approximation algorithm 

See Jacobson and Zou (2023) for details.
